# Web programming practice

- Time: **Wednesday 16:00 - 17:30**
- Location: **Southern Building 00.803 (Programming Language Laboratory)**
- Teacher: **Erik TÅ±ri**
- Contact: ***turierik@inf.elte.hu*** (or maybe Teams)
    - any messages from students via **other platforms** (including but not limited to: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Discord, etc) **WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT READING!**

## Rules
- Attending the practices is **mandatory!** Attendance is checked **at the beginning** of the classes (with attendance sheets or short quizzes), so please arrive on time. **If you miss more than 3 practices, you will NOT get a grade.**
- Deadlines are **NOT optional!** There will be NO extensions. _(You already have +2 weeks with point deduction on the two big projects anyway.)_ If you are late with your home project / exam submission, you fail the assignment and possibly the entire course. No exceptions will be allowed based on past negative experiences.
- Make sure to **upload the right file** everytime! If you upload the wrong file, you fail the assignment and possibly the entire course. It is only YOUR responsibility to verify that you have uploaded the correct submission.
- **Cheating in ANY manner or encouraging others to cheat will be taken VERY seriously. There will be NO second chances, any involved students will FAIL the course immediately.**
  - (Examples: using helping materials on the short quizzes, submitting third-party or copied code as your work, giving your work to other students, publishing any task on online sites/forums, etc.)
  - Please DO NOT upload your code to public places (e.g. GitHub, Pandora, etc) before the final deadline. If someone steals your work, we WILL NOT conduct investigations to find the source.
  - All submissions WILL BE CHECKED for internet plagiarism and internal matches. If an obvious match is found, everyone (including the source) involved fails the class.
